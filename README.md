# autocomplete


#### Simple autocomplete--different from industry autocomplete examples because: 
1. this algorithm does not change the likelihood of a term to appear in a search based on previous searches
2. this algorithm only considers terms that start with exact user query (not terms that contain the query)

###### Starter code given by professor, implementation is mine.
